{{% verse %}}
And am I born to die?
To lay this body down!
And must my trembling spirit fly
into a world unknown?
A land of deepest shade;
Unpierced by human thought.
The dreary regions of the dead,
Where all things are forgot.

Soon as from earth I go,
What will become of me?

â€” Charles Wesley, 1753
