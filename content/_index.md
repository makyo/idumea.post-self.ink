![Idumea by Madison Rye Progress](/cover-front.jpg)

> The Woman was too present. She was too much herself, too human, too embodied within her vessel as it spiraled out of control, too stuck in her mind as it twisted in on itself.
> 
> Readers, you must understand that she was in so many ways whole still!
>
> I think that The Woman would say, however, that she was too whole. I think she would say that she was too full, too much, too alive. I think she would say that almost three hundred years of a life that was lived as hers was was too much life. I think she would laugh that hoarse, dry laugh that always sounded like tears were on the way and say that thirty years was probably too much for her.

> But me, friends? What will become of me?

Coming August 1, the [Kickstarter campaign for *Idumea*](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/drabmakyo/idumea) will begin! Help fund a new novella in the Post-Self setting. Written by Madison Rye Progress with contributions from Samantha Yule Fireheart and Krzysztof "Tomash" Drewniak, the story explores the escape from samsara in a digital world, and the effects of trauma on the functionally immortal.

## Stretch goals

Should funding extend beyond the goal of $500, the scope of the project will be expanded!

* $1,000 — A hardcover edition of *Idumea.*
* $1,500 — Post-Self anthology of fairy tales and fables, with short stories written by members of the Post-Self community, with the authors being paid.
* $2,000 — A separate, commissioned cover illustration for the hardcover edition.
* $2,500 — Interior illustrations depicting some scenes in the style of old, serialized stories such as the original Pinocchio.

This story contains themes of self-harm, suicide, and poor mental health.

## About the author

[Madison Rye Progress](https://makyo.ink), like your humble narrator, is also struck by graphomania. She is one to wake at all hours and sneak off to her computer or take notes on her phone or simply pace the quiet rooms of her house, lonely, building worlds in her head. She sought relief from the Furry Writers' Guild, from the Regional Anthropomorphic Writers' Retreat with Kyell Gold and Dayna Smith, but they only encouraged her. She sought relief from Cornell college, but they only gave her an MFA in creative writing and pedagogy. She sought relief in her love, [Samantha Yule Fireheart](https://everdream.space), who lives with her in the Pacific Northwest, but they instead spend their days writing with each other, as does she with the Post-Self community, where she meet [Krzysztof "Tomash" Drewniak](https://kdrewniak.com) and where she curates the canon. 

She, too, wonders if she is born to die. What, dear readers, will become of her? What will become of her?
